    Founded in Ontario, Canada in 1963, WrenchGnasher's Repair Shop migrated to New
    York City in 1989 after a run of unsuccessful business decisons led to a near
    bankruptcy. Today, WrenchGnashers is a multi-state company with locations across
    32 states with major shops in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Oregon and
    California. They specialize in automotive repair but also have an active side
    business in custom vehicle design including converting vans to mobile homes,
    swapping out automatic transmissions for manuals and more.
